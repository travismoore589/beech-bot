# Tech Stack

The bot is written in javascript and makes heavy use of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/), which is a wrapper around the Discord API (view the [developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)).

I currently host the bot using the [Heroku Cloud Platform](https://heroku.com), and use a free add-on to provision a [PostgreSQL database](https://www.postgresql.org/), where I store the quotes for the single server where the bot operates. 

# Adding the bot to your own server(s)

Stored quotes are associated with a specific guild, so you can safely add the same instance of the bot to multiple servers. 

For the bot to run, you need to populate 3 environment variables referenced within the code. These are `process.env.CLIENT_ID`, `process.env.DATABASE_URL`, and `process.env.TOKEN`. Read below for how to obtain these.

1. You'll need to [create a discord application through the developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Your application will be assigned an "Application ID" (aka client id), which can be referenced in the "General Information" section. This will be the value of `process.env.CLIENT_ID`. 

2. Within that application, you'll need to add a bot. Within the "Bot" section of the application, you'll see the option to generate a token. This is the authentication token for your bot (and is thus very sensitive data). This will be the value of `process.env.TOKEN`.

3. You will need an instance of a PostgreSQL database, preferably version 14 to ensure compatibility with the "citext" extension - see "Database Schema" below. `process.env.DATABASE_URL` will need to be the value of the connection string for this database. That connection string will be structured like so:

    `postgres://your-username:your-password@your-host:your-port/your-database-name`. 
    
4. You'll need to populate the database with the appropriate schema. See the "Database Schema" section. 
    
5. You'll need to add the bot to your desired server. Within the "Bot" section of your Discord application, you can create a permissions integer that will be added to the OAuth link for a given bot. I recommend, at minimum, the "Send Messages", "Send Messages in Threads", and "Use Slash Commands" permissions, which produce integer `277025392640`. The link to add the bot would then be the following, with your application ID substituted in:

    `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=your-application-id&permissions=277025392640&scope=bot`
    
6. Lastly, run the bot on your chosen server with `npm start`. The bot should log in, and within the server you should see it's slash commands available by simply typing `/`. 

# Database Schema

The database has one table. The following should be all that is necessary to run:

```
CREATE EXTENSION citext;

CREATE COLLATION ci ( // case-insensitive collation for the author column.
  provider = 'icu',
  locale = 'utf-8@colStrength=secondary',
  deterministic = false
);

CREATE TABLE quotes(
    id SERIAL,
    quotation citext NOT NULL,
    author character varying(64) COLLATE ci NOT NULL,
    said_at date NOT NULL,
    guild_id character varying(64) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT quotes_pkey PRIMARY KEY (quotation, author, guild_id)
);
```
